# gregory

A polyglot experiment.

One of the first things I try to implement when learning a new language 
is [Gregory's Theorem](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/NewtonsForwardDifferenceFormula.html). 
It's simple enough in theory that all of my time can be spent on finding 
the most idiomatic way to express the solution for each language.

Some of the things I get to play with:
* Implementing a new datatype
* Functions to operate on that new datatype
* Syntatcitc sugar for data structures
* Iteration v. recursion v. declarativityness

p.s. I know the link above goes to an article about Newton but I learned 
this as Gregory's Theorem and have always called it such.

## Usage
For Java use `> mvn test`
For Clojure use `> lein repl`
